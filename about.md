# About Me

<img src="/assets/images/Profile_CHIU2.png" align="right" width="200px" style="margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 10px;" onerror="this.style.display='none'">

I am a researcher specializing in **Speech Science and Articulatory Phonetics**. My work primarily focuses on the motor control theories of speech and the development of methods for **quantifying articulatory structures** of the lips and tongue.

### Research Interests
* **Articulatory Phonology**: Investigating the coordination of speech gestures.
* **Motor Control**: Applying control theories to understand speech production.
* **Quantification Methods**: Developing precise measurements for tongue and lip movement.

### Professional Background
I have been deeply involved with the **Speech Behavior and Science Lab**, where I contributed to lab identity design and ongoing phonetic research. My recent projects include a presentation on articulatory quantification and exploring risk management in high-stakes phonetics experiments.
