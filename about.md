邱振豪副教授現任教於國立臺灣大學語言學研究所，研究聚焦於語言結構表徵及其生物力學基礎，結合多種生理量測技術，系統性探討發音構音器官的動態表現與控制機制，並於聲學—構音對應關係、語音產製控制，以及構音運動機制等議題上累積多項重要實證成果。基於語言學與語言結構分析的研究基礎，近年進一步拓展至人體工學與運作控制的跨域整合，並探索機器人語言模型之應用潛力，致力於將語言產製歷程中的多模態資訊導入人機互動與智慧系統設計。

邱副教授為國科會優秀年輕學者計畫主持人，並自 2025 年起擔任國際知名期刊 *Journal of Phonetics* 副主編（Associate Editor）。

Dr. Chenhao Chiu is currently an Associate Professor at Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Taiwan University. His research focuses on linguistic structural representations and their biomechanical foundations, integrating multiple physiological measurement techniques to investigate articulatory dynamics and control mechanisms in speech production. Dr. Chiu's work has contributed important empirical findings in acoustic–articulatory mapping, speech motor control, and articulatory movement processes. Building on a strong background in linguistic theory and structural analysis, Dr. Chiu has recently expanded his research toward interdisciplinary integration with ergonomics and control systems, while exploring applications of robotic language models. The current work emphasizes leveraging multimodal speech production data to advance human–computer interaction and intelligent system design.

Dr. Chiu is a recipient of the NSTC Outstanding Young Scholars Program and has served as Associate Editor of *Journal of Phonetics* since 2025.

### Research Interests
* **Articulatory Phonology**: Investigating the coordination of speech gestures.
* **Motor Control**: Applying control theories to understand speech production.
* **Quantification Methods**: Developing precise measurements for tongue and lip movement.

### Professional Background
I am currently an associate professor at the [Graduate Institute of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/) (**GIL**), and the PI of the [Speech Behavior and Science Lab](https://sbslab.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/) (**SBS**) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) (**NTU**). I am also affiliated with the *Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences* and *Neurobiology and Cognitive Science Center* (NCSC) at NTU.
